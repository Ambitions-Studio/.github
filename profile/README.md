## ℹ️ What is Ambitions Studio?

**Ambitions Studio** is an independent development studio building a **modern, scalable and developer-first ecosystem** for FiveM servers.

Our mission is simple:

> provide a clean, structured and production-ready foundation for serious RP servers — without compromise on quality or openness.

We ship tools that are:

- 🔋 **Powerful** – built for real production use  
- 🧼 **Clean & structured** – long-term maintainable  
- 🪟 **Fully open** – no paywalls, no obfuscation, no hidden core  

---

## 🧱 Ecosystem Overview

Ambitions Studio focuses on **long-term, maintainable and production-ready** solutions:

- ✅ **Ambitions Framework**  
  The heart of the ecosystem – a modern, standalone FiveM framework written in **Lua 5.4**, publicly available and actively developed.

- ✅ **Ambitions Multicharacter**  
  A first-party multicharacter system designed to integrate tightly with Ambitions Framework while staying modular and clean.

- 🧩 **Official Modules (Ecosystem)**  
  Not “core”, but first-party modules that showcase best practices and UX patterns:
  - **Ambitions Notify** – lightweight notification layer  
  - **Ambitions HUD** – modern and minimal HUD  
  - More modules will arrive iteratively

- 🖥️ **NUI Interfaces (coming soon)**  
  Responsive UI powered by **Vue 3** & **TailwindCSS**.

- 📊 **Tooling (coming soon)**  
  Performance monitoring, logging & integrations.

All components are built **from scratch**:

- no forks  
- no inherited legacy systems  
- no external “core” dependencies  

The only required dependency on the framework side is **oxmysql**, maintained by the CommunityOx team, for secure and high-performance MySQL / MariaDB interaction.

## 💡 Why Ambitions?

Most public frameworks are:

- too bloated,  
- too rigid,  
- or lacking proper documentation and long-term vision.

**Ambitions** was created to bridge that gap by providing:

- 🧠 A clear and consistent architecture  
- 👨‍💻 Developer-friendly patterns  
- 📘 Proper documentation & onboarding  
- 🔓 Fully open-source access (no paywalls, no obfuscation)  
- 🧩 A modular approach designed for the long run  

---

## 🗺️ Timeline & Roadmap

We’re transparent about the direction of the ecosystem.

**High-level timeline:**

- **Q2 2025 – Core Stabilization**  
  Focused on delivering a documented, modular and production-ready foundation.  
  This includes the internal library, import system and function organisation.

- **Q3 2025 – Ecosystem Expansion (to be detailed)**  
  Additional modules, NUI layers and integration patterns.

- **Q4 2025 – Tooling & Experience (to be detailed)**
